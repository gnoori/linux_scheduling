# linux_scheduling
Given a binary file containing PCB (Process Control Block) information about multiple processesâ€“written in  sequential  order,  simulate  a CPU  scheduling  using  differentscheduling algorithmsand different processors. Each processor is running completelyindependentusing a certainschedulingalgorithm (Priority Scheduling = 1, Shortest Job First = 2, Round Robin = 3). Make sure to provide load balancing when such operation is necessary.
